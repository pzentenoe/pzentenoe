### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm Pablo Zenteno, passionate about technology and a software developer. Currently, I serve as an Engineering Manager at [Walmart Chile](https://www.linkedin.com/company/walmart-chile-corp/). My work spans the development of innovative solutions; I've participated in various products and projects including the product search engine, MiClub 2.0, to projects focused on contactability (Hermes) and customer service like Care (HOLA), always with an emphasis on enhancing the user experience. I manage a wide range of technologies, including Go, Java, Android, Flutter, and React. Currently, I lead a multidisciplinary team responsible for delivering technological solutions and supporting the management and implementation of projects that aid operations. With a spirit always eager to learn ðŸ““, I continuously seek new ways to use technology to facilitate and enrich people's lives.
